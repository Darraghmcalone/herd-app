# Project Deliverables

This project uses the [UX Wireframes](./docs/ux-wireframes/) as a basis for the functionality and user experience delivered.

Due to various factors (including time constraints and ambiguity in the wireframes), some aspects of the delivered application differ from the UX wireframes.

## Log In screen

On the **Log In** screen:

- data entry fields are supplied for **Email address** and and **Password**
- no validation or authentication is actually implemented â€“ whatever data the user supplies is ignored, and user is taken straight to main app after pressing **Log In**
- no flow for user registration has been implemented

## Event screen

On the **Event** screen, the submenu in the middle of the screen (**About** / **Location** / **Events** / **Other**) has not been implemented because there is no functionality specified in the UX mockups.

## Navigation

The **Settings** menu item has been changed to **Log out**, because no functionality specified in UX mockups. There are also questions about how the UX would differ on an Android device (which already has the navigation as a drawer from the left of the screen).
